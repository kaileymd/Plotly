# Using Plotly to Display Bacteria Quantity
Please visit https://kaileymd.github.io/Plotly/ to view the results of this project.

This project aims to display the amount of belly button bacteria found in each subject's sample in several ways. By changing the subject's ID number, you can see at a glance the bacteria found in the highest quantities, see their names by hovering over the largest circles on the bubble chart, and one chart dedicated to displaying the subject's washing frequency.

Libraries used: D3, Plotly, JavaScript
